This blog is the home for essays, notes, and behind-the-scenes breakdowns of the work I do with founders and teams.

Here is what to expect:

- Practical playbooks you can apply immediately.
- Clear thinking on product strategy, positioning, and storytelling.
- Field notes from projects, launches, and experiments.

If you want to collaborate, reach out via email and include a short summary of your goals and timeline.
