When everything looks the same, the winners are the teams who ship with intent.

Here is a simple framework I use:

1. **Positioning**: Define the single sentence your audience should remember.
2. **Experience**: Make every screen feel inevitable to that sentence.
3. **Momentum**: Build in public with consistent storytelling.

This sequence keeps the work aligned, prevents rework, and helps your product feel inevitable.
